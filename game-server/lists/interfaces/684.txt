Child: 3, message: Watch out for rabbits wandering around the farmyard. They are hungry and will look for flags, as they often mean hidden food! If a rabbit eats the seed under a flag, you will not get any points for it and will lose the flag. 
Child: 4, message: You can improve your Hunter skill by finding ogleroots in the farmyard and feeding them to the rabbits. Ogleroots are magical vegetables and will cause the rabbit to disappear for a short amount of time.
